Download the GPG key: `wget -qO - https://download.sublimetext.com/sublimehq-pub.gpg | sudo apt-key add -`\n2. Add the repository to sources: Create a file named `sublime-text.list` in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d` and input repository information.\n3. Update apt: `sudo apt update`\n4. Install software: `sudo apt install sublime-text`\n\nTo remove software, reverse the process: Use `add-apt-repository --remove ppa:PPA_Name/ppa` or delete the file added earlier, then `sudo apt remove [software-name-here]`, e.g., `sudo apt remove sublime-text`.","x":166,"y":-45,"width":1174,"height":405},
