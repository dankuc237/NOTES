# Threats and Threats Actors
**Risk** is the fundamental concept, defined by the probability of a negative event and its potential impact. Cybersecurity professionals assess risks by considering how likely an attack is and its worst possible outcome.

**Threats** are specific causes of risk, which can be non-human (e.g., a lightning storm) or human (e.g., malicious programs). Human threats are often referred to as threat actors, indicating their agency and motives.

**Vulnerabilities** are flaws that allow threats to cause harm. Not all flaws are vulnerabilities; a flaw becomes a vulnerability if it poses a risk. For example, the Log4J vulnerability discovered in December 2021 allowed arbitrary code execution due to improper sanitization of user inputs, which resulted in a critical CVSS rating of 10.0.

**Exploits** occur when vulnerabilities are abused, either deliberately and maliciously, allowing unauthorized access or privileges. Exploits can be both the procedures used (noun) and the act of abusing vulnerabilities (verb).

**Attack surfaces** refer to all potential points of contact in a system that could be vulnerable, while **attack vectors** are specific combinations of vulnerabilities and exploits used by threat actors. Cybersecurity efforts focus on minimizing attack surfaces and identifying attack vectors.
# CIA triad
- **Confidentiality**: Can actors who should not have access to the system or information access the system or information?
- **Integrity**: Can the data or the system be modified in some way that is not intended?
- **Availability**: Are the data or the system accessible when and how they are intended to be?
# Security Principles
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: This principle ensures that every system component only has the minimum privileges necessary for its function, reducing the attack surface. The 2019 Capital One attack exemplifies the risks of not adhering to this principle, where excessive permissions granted to a Web Application Firewall led to a breach.
    
- **Zero Trust Security Model**: This model extends the Principle of Least Privilege by eliminating implicit trust within networks. It focuses on stringent, granular authorization for each access request and incorporates five key elements:
    
    - **Just in Time Access (JITA)**
    - **Just Enough Access (JEA)**
    - **Tokenization and Encryption**
    - **Dynamic Access Control Policies**
    - **Microsegmentation**
- **Open Security**: This principle asserts that a system's security should not depend on secrecy. The system should remain secure even if an attacker understands its security mechanisms. Exceptions like passwords still require secrecy.
    
- **Defense in Depth**: This strategy involves implementing multiple layers of defense within a system, ensuring that if one layer is breached, others can still provide protection. For example, a garage with multiple security layers (code, key lock, and alarm system) illustrates this concept. Many organizations fail to apply adequate defense in depth, relying too heavily on single points of failure.
## shift-left security
To avoid extra costs and availability impacts, it's best to design systems with built-in security rather than adding security layers later. This approach, known as **shift-left security**, involves incorporating security considerations from the beginning of the development process.

Without shift-left security, developers might release insecure products that require additional security layers, leading to potential inefficiencies. By involving the security team early, products can be designed with integrated controls, enhancing user experience and reducing the need for extra security services.

Most applications today rely on platform-level security controls, which can be effective but may also be weaker and easier to bypass. For instance, if a technology like Kubernetes provides all security services, a compromised administrator could disable these controls, jeopardizing security for all services.

Shift-left security can slow down production as developers need to consider security along with product specifications. Organizations must balance the trade-offs, as platform-level security controls, while potentially less robust, can facilitate faster development and market entry with reasonable security.
## Administrative Segmentation
It may seem okay to have an administrator bypass security controls based on their role and functional needs. Shouldn't we trust our administrators? However, when a threat is internal or otherwise able to obtain valid administrative credentials, our security posture becomes weaker. To defeat internal threats and threats that have acquired valid credentials or authentication capability, we must segment controls so that no single authority can bypass all controls. To accomplish this, we may need to split controls between application teams and administrators, or split access for administration between multiple administrators, as with [_Shamir's Secret Sharing_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing) (SSS).

With SSS, we might design a system so that three different administrator authorizations are required to authorize any one administrative root access. Shamir's secret sharing scheme enables a system to split access authorization requirements between multiple systems or persons. With this in place, we can design a system so that no one person has the root credentials.

# Laws and Regulations
Cybersecurity laws and regulations vary widely across different countries and jurisdictions. In the United States, several key laws are pivotal for security professionals to understand and comply with:

1. **HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)**: Enforced since 1996, HIPAA regulates the privacy and security of patient health information (PHI) in the healthcare industry. It mandates standards for protecting PHI, including electronic PHI (e-PHI), through administrative, physical, and technical safeguards. HIPAA also requires notification in case of PHI breaches and imposes penalties for non-compliance.

2. **FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act)**: Established in 1974, FERPA protects the privacy of students' education records. It limits the disclosure of these records without consent and grants rights to parents and eligible students to review and request changes to these records. Non-compliance may result in the loss of federal funding for educational institutions.

3. **GLBA (Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act)**: Passed in 1999, GLBA applies to financial institutions and requires them to safeguard consumers' financial information. It mandates institutions to disclose their information-sharing practices to consumers and allows consumers to opt-out in certain cases.

4. **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**: Implemented in 2018 by the EU, GDPR sets rigorous standards for data privacy and security. It applies to any organization handling personal data of individuals within the EU, regardless of the organization's location. GDPR grants individuals extensive rights over their data and imposes severe penalties for non-compliance, including fines up to 4% of global revenue or 20 million Euros.

5. **Key Disclosure Laws**: Found in various countries, these laws compel individuals to disclose cryptographic keys or passwords under specified conditions, often in criminal investigations. For instance, the UK's Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA) empowers authorities to demand decryption keys under penalty of imprisonment.

6. **CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)**: Effective from 2020, CCPA grants California residents rights over their personal information held by businesses. These rights include the right to know, opt-out, and delete personal information collected by businesses, with some exceptions.

Understanding and adhering to these laws is crucial for security professionals to ensure compliance and protect sensitive information as per legal requirements in their respective jurisdictions.

# Standards and Frameworks
- **PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)**: Established in 2004, PCI DSS sets requirements for organizations handling credit card data. It aims to secure payment data and prevent credit card fraud by enforcing best practices in network security, access control, and data protection. Compliance is assessed annually.
    
- **CIS Top 18 (Center for Internet Security Critical Security Controls)**: This set of 18 controls, previously 20, outlines recommended practices to enhance organizational security posture. It covers areas like data protection, access control, vulnerability management, and malware detection. Controls are categorized into implementation groups (IG1, IG2, IG3) to assist in prioritizing implementation based on organizational complexity and data sensitivity.
    
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Developed by NIST, this framework helps organizations manage and reduce cybersecurity risks. It consists of Core functions (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover), each containing categories and subcategories that define specific security outcomes. Implementation Tiers gauge how well organizations meet these outcomes, while Profiles help compare current and target cybersecurity postures.
    
- **MITRE ATT&CK and D3FEND**: ATT&CK catalogs attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to aid defenders in understanding and mitigating threats. D3FEND, the defensive counterpart, provides best practices and methodologies for defenders to prevent, detect, and respond to attacks effectively.
    
- **ISA/IEC 62443**: Focused on Industrial Automation and Control Systems (IACS) security, this standard outlines security requirements and best practices for securing Operational Technology (OT) environments.
    
- **Cyber Kill Chain**: Developed by Lockheed Martin, this methodology breaks down cyber attacks into seven stages (reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, exploitation, installation, command and control, actions on objectives) to help defenders understand and thwart attacks at each phase.
    
- **FedRAMP (Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program)**: Designed for U.S. government cloud services, FedRAMP provides a standardized security framework based on NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4. It aims to ensure cloud services used by federal agencies meet stringent security standards while streamlining authorization processes across agencies.

# Additional
**Information Security Officer**: There are various titles for the head of a cybersecurity program including _Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)_, _Chief Security Officer (CSO)_, _Principal Security Officer (PSO)_, _Information Security Officer (ISO)_, and so on. Working to the CISO, there are management roles leading teams within the security function, for example _Manager Governance, Risk & Controls (Manager GRC)_ and _Manager SOC_. These are all cybersecurity governance functions and are suitable for experienced cybersecurity specialists.

**Security Tester**: There are many security assurance roles beyond those involving hands-on pen testing, starting with the [_Security Tester_](https://www.istqb.org/certifications/security-tester), a role which is typically part of the development team and which is responsible for running security test cases on products to verify that the security features work as documented. The role of [_Security Controls Assessor (SCA)_](https://niccs.cisa.gov/workforce-development/nice-framework/work-roles/security-control-assessor) involves validating the operation of controls in advance of an audit or compliance check. A special type of testing role is the [_Common Criteria Security Evaluator_](https://www.cclab.com/news/what-are-the-main-steps-of-common-criteria-evaluation) whose role it is to evaluate vendor products to ensure they meet their claimed security functionality and assurance levels.

**Security Assurance Officer**. There are a number of terms used to describe security assurance roles all of which are focused on verifying that controls exists in systems under review and are operating correctly. These include [_Security Assurance Officers_](https://itbrief.com.au/story/strengthening-cybersecurity-the-rise-of-the-security-assurance-officer), [_Security Compliance Officers_](https://www.nviso.eu/job/security-compliance-officer), and [_Cyber Security Auditors_](https://www.isaca.org/credentialing/cybersecurity-audit-certificate).
