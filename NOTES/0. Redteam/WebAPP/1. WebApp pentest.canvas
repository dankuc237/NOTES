Same Origin Policy (SOP) is consulted when cross-site HTTP requests are initiated from within client side scripts (IE: JavaScript), or when an Ajax request is run.\n\nThe main rule of SOP is: \n*A document can access (through JavaScript) the properties of another document only if they have the same origin.* \nMore precisely, the browser always performs the request successfully but it returns the response to the user only if the SOP is respected.\nWith the term document, we are referring to an HTML page, an iframe included in the main page, or a response to an Ajax request. Images, style information (*.css) and JavaScript files (*.js) are excluded from the previous statement; they are always accessible regardless their origin, and the browser loads them without consulting SOP.\n\n\nLet us see some SOP examples applied to the following address: http://els.ptp.site/index.php: \n\n|URL| SOP| Reason|\n|-|-|-|\n|http://els.ptp.site/admin/index.php| OK | Same protocol, host and port |\n|https://els.ptp.site/index.php |X | Different protocol |\n|http://els.ptp.site/index.php:8080 |X | Different port |\n|http://www.els.ptp.site/index.php |X | Different host  |\nContent from `about:blank`, `JavaScript:` and `data:` inherits the origin.\n# What would it happen if SOP did not exist?\nYour evil friend could craft a malicious page, and convince you to visit it. Once you visited the page, he could then have (some) access to personal information from your bank account.\n","x":-400,"y":140,"width":800,"height":900},

This means that a website cannot retain the state of visit between different HTTP requests without mechanisms such as sessions or cookies.\nInvented to essentially make HTTP stateful.\n\nA server can set a cookie via the `Set-Cookie` HTTP header field in a response message. A cookie has a predefined format. It contains the following fields:Domain, Expires, Path, Content, HTTP Only Flag, Secure Flag.\n1. **Domain**<br>The scope of this cookie will be `.google.com` Domain A cannot set a cookie for domain B. The browser will sends A's cookie in accordance with the above domain scope (to A and all of its subdomains), including the path and the expiration date. <br>There are two important considerations about the domain field:<br>- leading\".\", if present, is ignored:<br>- if the server does not specify the domain attribute, the browser will automatically set the domain as the server domain and set the cookie’s host-only flag. This means that the cookie will be sent only to that precise hostname.<br><br>\n1. **Expires**<br>Gives the cookie a time constraint. The cookie will only be sent to the server if it has not expired. Session cookies expire when the session exits.<br><br>\n1. **Path**<br>Specifies for which requests, within that domain, the browser needs to send the cookie. For cookies with `path=/downloads`, all subsequent requests to: `/downloads`, `/downloads/foo`, `/downloads/foo/bar` will include this cookie. The browser will **not send** this cookie for requests to `/blog` or `/members`<br><br>\n1. **Content**<br>Carry a number of values at once. A server can set multiple values with a single `Set-Cookie` header by specifying multiple `KEY=Value` pairs. For example: `Set-Cookie: Username=\"john\"; Authenticated=\"1\"`<br><br>\n1. **HTTP Only<br>Used to force the browser to send the cookie only through HTTP. This flag prevents the cookie from being read via JavaScript, Flash, Java or any other non-HTML technology. This is a protection mechanism against cookie stealing via XSS.<br><br>\n1. **Secure**<br>forces the browser to send the cookie only through HTTPS (SSL). This prevents the cookie from being sent in clear text.","x":1040,"y":140,"width":820,"height":1040},
