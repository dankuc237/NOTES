# Fundamentals

- **Encryption**: A two-way process where data is "scrambled" (encrypted) and "unscrambled" (decrypted) using a key.
  - **Symmetric Encryption**: Uses the same key for encryption and decryption (e.g., AES).
  - **Asymmetric Encryption**: Uses a key pair (public and private keys) for encryption and decryption (e.g., RSA).

- **Hashing**: Cryptographic hash functions (e.g., SHA1, MD5) are one-way, producing a unique hash from input data. Hashes are used for secure password storage.
	- **Cryptographic Hash Functions**: Common algorithms include MD5, SHA1, and SHA256, which produce unique hash values for unique inputs.

## Password Cracking
- **Cracking Encrypted Passwords**: Requires discovering the encryption key.
- **Cracking Hashed Passwords**: Involves hashing potential plaintexts and comparing the results with the target hash.

# Tools for Cracking
- **Hashcat**: Primarily a GPU-based tool, also supports CPUs. Requires OpenCL or CUDA for GPU cracking.
- **John the Ripper (JtR)**: Primarily CPU-based but supports GPUs.
