# Understanding Digital Signatures: A Step-by-Step Guide

Digital signatures are a fundamental security mechanism that ensure a digital message or document is authentic (really from the claimed sender) and has not been tampered with in transit[cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/understanding-digital-signatures#:~:text=A%20digital%20signature%E2%80%94a%20type%20of,other%20forms%20of%20electronic%20signatures). In simple terms, a digital signature attaches a unique code to a message, much like a virtual fingerprint unique to the sender, to **verify the sender’s identity and protect the message’s integrity**[cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/understanding-digital-signatures#:~:text=A%20digital%20signature%E2%80%94a%20type%20of,other%20forms%20of%20electronic%20signatures). This is achieved using **public-key cryptography** (also called asymmetric cryptography), which relies on a pair of keys – one private and one public[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature#:~:text=Digital%20signatures%20employ%20asymmetric%20cryptography,Digital%20signatures). Only the private key’s owner can create the signature, and the corresponding public key is used by anyone else to check it. Below, we explain the digital signature process in four main steps, using clear language for those with basic IT knowledge.

## Step 1: Key Generation (Public and Private Keys)

The first step is to generate a **key pair**: a private key and a public key. These keys are created together by a cryptographic algorithm and are mathematically related[techtarget.com](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/answer/Which-private-keys-and-public-keys-can-create-a-digital-signature#:~:text=encryption%2C%20a%20public%20key%20and,authenticity%20to%20the%20sender%27s%20message). The private key is kept secret by the owner and **never shared**; the public key can be distributed widely to anyone who needs to verify the owner’s signatures[techtarget.com](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/answer/Which-private-keys-and-public-keys-can-create-a-digital-signature#:~:text=In%20cryptography%2C%20a%20key%20is,a%20public%20key%20infrastructure%20system). Despite their relationship, it is **computationally infeasible** to figure out the private key from the public key[techtarget.com](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/answer/Which-private-keys-and-public-keys-can-create-a-digital-signature#:~:text=encryption%2C%20a%20public%20key%20and,authenticity%20to%20the%20sender%27s%20message) – this one-way relationship is what makes the system secure.

- **Private Key:** A secret key known only to the signer. This will be used to create (encrypt) the digital signature.
    
- **Public Key:** A key that can be shared with recipients. This will be used to verify (decrypt) the digital signature.
    

_How it works:_ Think of the key pair like a signing stamp and a verification guide. **The private key** is like your personal stamp or seal – you use it to **sign** documents. **The public key** is like a published reference sample – anyone can use it to check that a signature is genuine and was stamped by your unique seal. Key generation algorithms (for example, RSA or ECDSA) create these two keys such that they work as a pair. It’s crucial to keep the private key safe (e.g. protected by a password or in secure hardware), because anyone with your private key could impersonate you by creating valid signatures[techtarget.com](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/answer/Which-private-keys-and-public-keys-can-create-a-digital-signature#:~:text=The%20process%20of%20signing%20digital,the%20private%20key%20holder%27s%20name)[techtarget.com](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/answer/Which-private-keys-and-public-keys-can-create-a-digital-signature#:~:text=individual%20creating%20the%20digital%20signature,the%20private%20key%20holder%27s%20name).

## Step 2: Signing a Message (Hashing + Private Key Encryption)

Once a key pair is available, the sender can **sign a message**. This involves two sub-steps: **hashing the message** and **encrypting the hash with the private key**.

1. **Hash the Message:** The original message is input into a cryptographic **hash function** to produce a fixed-size string of bytes known as a **hash value** (or message digest). This hash is essentially a **fingerprint** of the message – it’s unique to the message’s content[cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/understanding-digital-signatures#:~:text=Digital%20signatures%20work%20by%20proving,will%20completely%20change%20the%20hash). Even a tiny change in the message (like altering a single character) would result in a completely different hash value[cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/understanding-digital-signatures#:~:text=Digital%20signatures%20work%20by%20proving,will%20completely%20change%20the%20hash). Hash functions such as SHA-256 or SHA-3 are commonly used to ensure this property. By hashing the message, we condense the data into a short, manageable format for signing.
    
2. **Encrypt the Hash with the Private Key:** The sender’s private key is then used to **encrypt the hash value**, producing the **digital signature**[cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/understanding-digital-signatures#:~:text=Digital%20signatures%20work%20by%20proving,will%20completely%20change%20the%20hash). Essentially, the signature is a piece of data created from the hash by the private key. (In practice, “encrypting” with a private key is equivalent to signing – it means only the corresponding public key will be able to decrypt this data.) This signed hash is attached to the message as the digital signature. The reason we sign the hash instead of the entire message is efficiency: public-key algorithms are slow for large data, so signing a short hash is much faster and more practical[techtarget.com](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/answer/Which-private-keys-and-public-keys-can-create-a-digital-signature#:~:text=Public%20key%20encryption%20is%20quite,of%20the%20document%20is%20assured). Moreover, since the hash uniquely represents the message, signing the hash is as good as signing the message itself[techtarget.com](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/answer/Which-private-keys-and-public-keys-can-create-a-digital-signature#:~:text=Public%20key%20encryption%20is%20quite,of%20the%20document%20is%20assured).
    

At this point, the sender’s message now has an **attached signature**. The signature is essentially a coded version of the message’s fingerprint, locked with the sender’s private key. This code can later be unlocked only with the sender’s public key, proving that the sender (and no one else) signed the message[techtarget.com](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/answer/Which-private-keys-and-public-keys-can-create-a-digital-signature#:~:text=encryption%2C%20a%20public%20key%20and,authenticity%20to%20the%20sender%27s%20message).

## Step 3: Sending the Signed Message

With the message and its digital signature prepared, the sender transmits both to the intended recipient. The **original message (in plain text)** and the **digital signature (the encrypted hash)** are sent together. The signature might be appended to the message, or delivered as a separate file or block of data, depending on the application.

It’s important that the recipient either already possesses the sender’s **public key** or has a reliable way to obtain it (for example, from a certificate or a trusted directory). In many implementations, digital signatures are used in combination with a **public key infrastructure (PKI)** where a certificate authority vouches for whose public key is whose, adding an extra layer of trust. But at a basic level, as long as the receiver has the correct public key corresponding to the sender’s private key, they can proceed to verify the signature.

**Integrity in transit:** Even if the message is sent over an insecure channel (like the internet), the signature will reveal if anyone alters the message in transit. If a malicious actor modified the message, the signature verification would fail because the hash would no longer match (more on verification in the next step). Likewise, the signature cannot be forged by someone who doesn’t possess the private key, so the recipient is confident the message genuinely came from the claimed sender.

## Step 4: Verifying the Signature (Decrypt with Public Key & Compare Hashes)

_Figure: Simplified digital signature process._ _In this example, Alice (the sender) signs the message "Hello Bob!" using her private key (blue key) to produce a signature (yellow hashed value). Bob (the recipient) uses Alice’s public key (orange key) to decrypt the signature and recover the hash. He then compares it to the hash he computes from the received message. The outcome of verification is shown as a green “True” bubble, indicating the message is authentic and unchanged._

When the recipient (Bob, in our example) receives the message and the attached signature, he performs the **verification process**:

- **Recompute the Hash:** Bob takes the received message and runs it through the **same hash function** the sender used, producing his own hash value from the message. This gives Bob the message’s expected fingerprint based on its content as received.
    
- **Decrypt the Signature with the Public Key:** Bob then uses the sender’s public key to **decrypt the signature** he received. Remember that the signature was the hash encrypted with Alice’s private key. Decrypting it with Alice’s public key should therefore reveal the **original hash value** that Alice computed for the message[cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/understanding-digital-signatures#:~:text=Once%20completed%2C%20the%20message%20or,and%20the%20sender%20is%20authenticated). (If the public key fails to decrypt properly or the result is nonsense, it’s a sign the signature was not actually made with the matching private key – indicating a problem with authenticity.)
    
- **Compare the Hashes:** Now Bob compares the hash he computed from the message to the hash he obtained by decrypting Alice’s signature. **If the two hash values are identical,** it means that the message has not been altered (the content is exactly what Alice signed) and that the signature must have been generated by Alice’s private key (since the public key correctly decrypted it)[cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/understanding-digital-signatures#:~:text=Once%20completed%2C%20the%20message%20or,and%20the%20sender%20is%20authenticated). In other words, a match confirms both **integrity** (no tampering) and **authenticity** (it was indeed signed by Alice). If the hash values do **not** match, the verification fails – this would warn Bob that the message may have been corrupted or tampered with, or that the signature is not valid for this message.
    

When verification succeeds (hashes match), Bob can be confident that the message **came from Alice and was not modified en route**[cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/understanding-digital-signatures#:~:text=Once%20completed%2C%20the%20message%20or,and%20the%20sender%20is%20authenticated). The digital signature thus fulfills its purpose: it provides cryptographic proof of the sender’s identity and the message’s integrity. If anyone had altered the message, the hashes would differ and the signature check would fail, alerting the receiver to a problem[cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/understanding-digital-signatures#:~:text=Once%20completed%2C%20the%20message%20or,and%20the%20sender%20is%20authenticated). Likewise, no impostor could forge a valid signature on Alice’s behalf without having her private key, so Bob knows the message truly came from Alice[techtarget.com](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/answer/Which-private-keys-and-public-keys-can-create-a-digital-signature#:~:text=encryption%2C%20a%20public%20key%20and,authenticity%20to%20the%20sender%27s%20message).

## Conclusion

Digital signatures combine the power of hash functions and asymmetric encryption to deliver strong security guarantees. In summary, the process involves: generating a private/public key pair, signing a message by hashing it and encrypting that hash with the private key, and then sending the message with its signature so that the recipient can verify it by decrypting the hash with the public key and comparing it to their own hash of the message. Through these steps, **any change to the message will be detected, and only the genuine sender could have produced the valid signature**, ensuring both integrity and authenticity of the communication[cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/understanding-digital-signatures#:~:text=Once%20completed%2C%20the%20message%20or,and%20the%20sender%20is%20authenticated)[cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/understanding-digital-signatures#:~:text=A%20digital%20signature%E2%80%94a%20type%20of,other%20forms%20of%20electronic%20signatures). Digital signatures are widely used today – from secure email and software distribution to electronic contracts – providing a digital equivalent of a tamper-evident seal and a personal signature, rolled into one cryptographic tool.

**Key Takeaways:** Digital signatures rely on a private key (known only to the signer) and a corresponding public key (shared with everyone). The signer creates a signature by hashing the message and encrypting the hash with the private key[cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/understanding-digital-signatures#:~:text=Digital%20signatures%20work%20by%20proving,will%20completely%20change%20the%20hash). The signature, attached to the message, can be verified by anyone with the public key, by decrypting the signature and checking that the decrypted hash matches a fresh hash of the message[cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/understanding-digital-signatures#:~:text=Once%20completed%2C%20the%20message%20or,and%20the%20sender%20is%20authenticated). This process assures the receiver that the message is **authentic and unchanged**, bolstering trust in digital communications.
