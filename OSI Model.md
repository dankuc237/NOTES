|**Layer**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|7. Application Layer|Human-computer interaction layer, where applications can access the network services|
|6. Presentation Layer|Ensures that data is in a usable format and is where data encryption occurs|
|5. Session Layer|Maintains connections and is responsible for controlling ports and sessions|
|4. Transport Layer|Transmits data using transmission protocols including TCP and UDP|
|3. Network Layer|Decides which physical path the data will take|
|2. Data Link Layer|Defines the format of data on the network|
|1. Physical Layer|Transmits raw bit stream over the physical medium|

A packet is the protocol data unit for the network layer (3), and a frame is a unit in the data link layer (2). Packet capture is actually a misnomer because some hardware can capture at layer 3, but sometimes also at layer 2. Some specialized tools can even do layer 1.
